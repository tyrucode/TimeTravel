/* Task 1: Declare a Destination Variable */
// TODO: Use `let` to declare a variable named `destination` and assign it the value `"Ancient Egypt"`. Print the destination to the console.
let destination = "Ancient Egypt";
console.log(destination);
/* Task 2: Change the Destination */
// TODO: Now, change the `destination` variable to `"Medieval Europe"`. Print the new destination to the console.
destination = "Medieval Europe";
console.log(destination);
/* Task 3: Declare a Constant Travel Date */
// TODO: Use `const` to declare a variable named `travelDate` and set it to `"2024-03-15"`. Try to change the `travelDate` to another value and observe and explain what happens as a comment.
const travelDate = "2024-03-15";
travelDate = "another value";
/*
 * Observations: TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
 * TODO: Explain here. To fix this we can not declare it as a const and use let instead so that it is changeable. 
 */

/* Task 4: Experiment with Variable Hoisting */
// TODO: Before declaring any variable, try to print a variable named `timeMachineModel` to the console. Then, declare `timeMachineModel` using `var` and assign it the value `"T-800"`. Observe and explain what happens as a comment.
console.log(timeMachineModel);
var timeMachineModel = "T-800";
/*
 * Observations: It printed "t-800"
 * TODO: Explain here.  It did this because timeMachineModel is hoisted to the top before the rest of the code allowing it to work even if it doesnt seem to be declared yet.
